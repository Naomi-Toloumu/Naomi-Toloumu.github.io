Learning new languages can be challenging, especially as an adult, due to the complexities of grammar and syntax. Research shows that children, being like a "blank canvas," have an easier time mastering new languages compared to adults, who often struggle with existing knowledge and rules. Despite these challenges, many, including myself, are determined to push past these limitations and continue learning.

I decided to focus on coding, diving into the world of Computer Science. The field is constantly evolving, and staying updated is crucial. Without formal education in high school, I initially taught myself. However, my learning approach shifted significantly when I started with Java as my first official programming language. Transitioning from Java to TypeScript marked a notable change in my coding journey.

TypeScript felt both familiar and distinct from Java. Its syntax was relatively easy to learn, but its conventions, like using functions instead of Java’s public class and static void, were new. TypeScript’s method of declaring variables in a single line was a departure from Java’s more verbose approach. This streamlined syntax made coding more efficient and less cumbersome.

Despite a challenging start with TypeScript, I found it to be a valuable language for software engineering. TypeScript’s type annotations and structured approach help catch errors early and improve code readability. This experience has shown me the benefits of adapting to new languages and their unique paradigms.

Although I initially struggled and didn't finish challenges within the allotted time, I found satisfaction in solving problems without full reliance on AI tools like ChatGPT. Moving forward, I aim to become proficient in TypeScript and develop strong problem-solving skills to enhance my programming capabilities.
