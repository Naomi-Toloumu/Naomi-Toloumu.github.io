## The Origin + Correlation to Computer Science

My affinity for solving intricate puzzles has been a cornerstone of my personal development. Engaging with complex and challenging puzzles has instilled in me a deep sense of patience and a meticulous attention to detail. These qualities are essential in software engineering, where each problem requires thoughtful consideration and methodical problem-solving. Embracing the challenge of solving these puzzles has fostered a mindset that I believe will serve me well in tackling the demanding aspects of software engineering.

Embarking on this course, I anticipated encountering various challenges, especially with the rigorous reviews and the introduction of new programming languages. Starting from the basics and working my way up is both exhilarating and daunting. The breadth of knowledge required can sometimes feel overwhelming, yet I am driven by the potential rewards. I recognize that the field of Computer Science is inherently filled with uncertainties, but it also offers a wealth of opportunities for growth and innovation.

Despite the hurdles, my commitment to this path remains steadfast. I am eager to engage with the ever-evolving landscape of technology and contribute to advancements within the field. This journey, while challenging, promises to broaden my horizons and equip me with the skills needed to thrive in a dynamic and rapidly advancing environment. My enthusiasm for the subject and determination to overcome obstacles reflect my readiness to embrace the risks and rewards that lie ahead in my career as a software engineer.

## Skills & Experiences

I’m eagerly anticipating the Capstone Project as the highlight of my journey. I aim to master key skills such as effective programming, independent troubleshooting, and confident use of object-oriented design. I also look forward to improving my teamwork abilities. The Capstone will test my technical skills and personal growth, and despite any challenges, I’m committed to persevering and using these experiences to improve and succeed. This project will push my limits and help me grow both professionally and personally.
