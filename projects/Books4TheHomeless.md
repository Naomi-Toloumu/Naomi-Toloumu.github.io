Books 4 the Homeless is a senior project that I proposed to me team of
fellow classmates with the goal of involving students from all grade levels.
We focused on those who seek both educational resources and a source of
comfort and entertainment. Understanding the significant role books play in our
lives as avid readers, we wanted to extend this beenfit to others who might find solace
and enrichment through reading.

Final Results:
1st - Freshmen (236)
2nd - Sophmores (125)
3rd - Seniors (45)
4th - Juniors (0)

The first place winners received a free pizza party that included drinks, cookies
and chips with the enormous amount of books that they contributed.
