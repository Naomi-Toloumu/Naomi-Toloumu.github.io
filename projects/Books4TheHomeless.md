Books 4 the Homeless is a senior project that I proposed to me team of
fellow classmates with the goal of involving students from all grade levels.
We focused on those who seek both educational resources and a source of
comfort and entertainment. Understanding the significant role books play in our
lives as avid readers, we wanted to extend this beenfit to others who might find solace
and enrichment through reading.

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming. 

Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
