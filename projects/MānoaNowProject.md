The Mānoa Now Marketplace is the result of a collaborative effort amongst a group of software engineering (ICS 314) students at the University of Hawai‘i, working together to create a seamless platform for buying, selling, and trading a wide variety of items.

In this project, I took up the role of front-end development alongside our leader, focusing on designing and implementing the user interface (UI) to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience for users.

My role involved creating the visual elements such as the cart page and navbars. But also I had to make it fully functional with routing amongst other techniques. 

Through collaboration with the back-end team, we were able to achieve this goal of a fully functional, user friendly website.
