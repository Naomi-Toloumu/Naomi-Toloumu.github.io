As I walked the halls of Radford High School, I noticed piles
of plastic waste scattered around the school, particularly near
high-traffic areas like the cafeteria and vending machines in the main hallway.
Inspired by this, I designed a fun and innovative system aimed at encouraging
students to sort their cans and bottles more effectively by making
the process engaging and enjoyable.

This project had taken me about two to three months with the end product looking
absolutely phenomenal. It was adapted and donated to Radford High School's
Green Team, where they carried on a legacy of recycling.
